# Images

![](https://youtu.be/CI4noac5ibE)

Add this line to the end of your code:

```html
<img src="mark.png">
```

And you should see Mark's face popping out at the end of the page

## Challenge #1: Multimark

Achieve this:

![multimark](images/multimark.png)

<details>
<summary>Reveal Answer</summary>

```html
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
<img src="mark.png">
```

</details>

That's how we put images on a webpage!

Now we're going to import our own images, but first let's look at how we manage files here on Replit, like where do that `mark.png` come from.

## Managing Files

Look at the sidebar on the left side, and click on the second icon, it'll take us to the File tree.

![click the second icon on the sidebar to enter Files tab](images/files.png)

Here's where we store all our files. You can see we're currently editing `index.html`, which is the code for our web page, and there's a `mark.png`, which we just imported to our web page.

## Challenge #2: Add your own image

To upload your own image, go to the file explorer on your system, and drag the image file to the file tree like this.

After uploading your own image, mimick the `<img>` syntax above and add your own image to the web page!

## Explanation

`<img>` is a different type of tag than what we used before like `<p>`: it doesn't have a closing tag! It doesn't have nested content, and its behavior is described through **attributes**

![tags with attribute](images/imgtag.png)

In this case we use the `src` (stands for "source") attribute to define the path to the image file.

## Challenge #3: Other Image Attributes

Try this

```html
<img src="mark.png" alt="an image of mark" width="640" height="240">
```

(it probably won't look good on `mark.png` because the original image is small! try with your own image)

## Sharing Your Website

By this time, you can already make a simple website with text and images that you can share with people! See the URL in the webview header? That's the URL to your website and you can copy it and share it to people.

When I'm following this tutorial I made a [photo album of my cat lil fang](https://lilfang.slmjkdbtl.repl.co/) just by using what we learned:
