## ðŸ‘‰ TRY IT : ......
1. Create a link with `<a>` tag using the code below:

```html
<a href="https://replit.com">this is a link to the replit site</a>
```



<details>
<summary>See what Mark did</summary>

Nest `<a>` inside a `<p>`

```html
<p>Here's my favorite <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrus_orthocanna">fish</a></p>
```
 
</details>


2. See if you can figure out how to make it so that clicking on an image takes you to a link.

<details>
<summary>See what Mark did</summary>

```html
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwXbp9bLlY"><img src="mark.png"></a>
```

## History: First Webpage Ever

Fun fact: We can already recreate the first web page ever with what we've learned!

You can safely say your HTML knowledge is on par with Sir Tim Berners-Lee when he created the World Wide Web.

But really, we've already grasped the core of the internet: Links! It's just a giant web with information linking to other information.

## Extra credit

- A lot of people just use services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/) for their personal website, we already learned how to do this ourselves!

- Try to make a simple site where it just lists some links to your works, your interests or your internet presence elsewhere.


- Now that we have the ability to link to other sites, try make a website with multiple pages that contains links to one another (watch the end of the video for tips)! 



## Let's summarize:
- Create a link using `<a>` tag.
- The attribute `href` (hypertext reference) defines what link the text will send to. This is where you add the website link.
- Don't forget to add `https://` when adding the website link.
- The code between `> </a>` is the text that will appear on your webpage.
- Turn an `<img` into a link by adding the `<a href=` tag at the start.

  ### Next, let's spice up your website with audio/video and different types of text.
