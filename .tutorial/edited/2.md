# Adding Some Text

In this lesson we're going to learn about adding text to a web page.

First let's look at what we currently have in the editor:

```html
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Mark</p>
<p>I like <b>boxing</b> and <i>fishing</i></p>
```

Before doing anything, let's first see what this code does. You should see this thing up there on the header, smash it.

![smash this thing (the one in the header, not this one!)](images/run.png)

You should see something like this pops up on the right side:

![hello](images/hello.png)

This is the content of our web page! 

These will be the 3 parts we interact with the most: **Code editor**, **Run button**, and **Output pane**

## Observe

Look at the code and look at the output, try to find which part of the code matches which part of the output.

Before explaining how the code works, let's try mess around with it first.

## Challenge #1: Change Text

1. Change `Mark` to your own name (feel free to skip this part if your name is Mark)
1. change the hobbies to your hobbies (feel free to skip this part if your hobbies are indeed boxing and fishing)

> Remember to always smash that Run button after you make a change!

## Explanation

Stuff like `<p>` are called HTML tags. Before diving deeper into how works, here's the basic structure:

![one HTML element](images/tag.png)

The letter inside the tag often implies what the tag does:

- `<p>` means paragraph
- `<h1>` means header 1
- `<b>` means bold
- `<i>` means italic

Read more about it on the [MDN doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Element)

## Challenge #2: Add More Text

Add more lines of text under to tell people more about you (favorite music / anime, achievements etc)

### Bonus
Use **Bold** and _italic_ text to highlight important stuff

<details>
<summary>Click to see what Mark added</summary>

Here's what Mark have:

```html
<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p>My name is Mark</p>
<p>I like <b>boxing</b> and <i>fishing</i></p>
<p>My favorite band is <b>Can</b>, my favorite album is <i>Ege Bamyasi</i></p>
<p>I've won prizes in <b>3</b> fishing competitions</p>
<p>I have a best friend, his name is <b>Bean</b></p>
```

</details>

Next up we're going to add some images.

## Challenge #3: Other Text Styles

There are a lot of other tags that lets you present text in other ways, try these:

- `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>` for other header variants
- `<small>` for smaller text
- `<pre>` for preformatted text (will preserve white space)
- `<code>` for code snippets (will use monospace font)
- `<u>` to underline text
- `<mark>` to highlight text
- `<del>` to cross over words
- `<sub>` and `<sup>` to render text as subscript / super script

Some of these might be less commonly used, but worth knowing!
