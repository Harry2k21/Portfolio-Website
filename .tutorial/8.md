# 8. Make A Website

You've already learned the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**! Now let's make a website.


## Planning

What kind of site are we building?

Is it a portfolio site showcasing my works? Is it a family photo album site? Is it a site for my band or club?

What content should this site include?

## Designing

What kind of visual style do I want for my site?

Should it be a goofy site with some silly visuals, or is it a serious site that's used in professional setting?

Find out what your style and who your audience is, and decide on a visual style that you like.

## Coding

You're good to start coding now!

Remember, use the search engine if there's something you don't know how to do, google `How to do ... in HTML / CSS` and you will find some good answers. All good programmers use search engines daily.
